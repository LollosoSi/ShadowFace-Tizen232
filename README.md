# ShadowFace-Tizen232
The battery friendly analog watchface designed for tizen devices  

# Features, Objectives & FAQ
*Why this watchface is different?*  
Like the Wear OS version, I had a couple reasons to code my own watchface:  
* Know the sources
* Optimize code for minimum battery usage
* Have an **analog** watchface
* Avoid **burn-in**  

**Features**
* **STRONG** burn-in protection:  
* - Disappearing clock ticks  
* - Weekly shrinking  
* - Low pixel on ratio design with strategical item positions  
combined with the system standard protection make this watchface a good candidate for the safest ones on earth  
* Battery bar as minutes watch hand.  Would you still notice without knowihg it?
* **Faster reading** with the digital **fused** with analog.  
Some say the two aren't married, in fact why would you have both clearly visible?  
With hours as hours, minutes as minutes, seconds as seconds, you get both. All on the analog.
* **Even Faster reading** with the right colors.  
The closest minute is highlighted too!
* Further dim Always On Display mode (*can be set in project files*)
* Ticking sound! (*a total of 4 different sounds is available as of 17/04/2020*)

*If you wanted a battery friendly watchface, why aren't you just using a plain digital one?*  
I have a round watch.  

*Why is this unavailable in the store?*  
Unfortunately it is closed for new watchface developers at the moment.  
Will re-attempt on August, 2020  

*How can I install it?*
